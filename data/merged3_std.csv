Children need many experiences grouping and separating objects to understand the meaning of these two operations. They also need to see and use number facts (such as 3 × 5 and 12 ÷ 4) in a variety of contexts, such as in describing sets of objects or pictures, or solving word problems, in order to achieve mastery. Research has shown that repetition is essential for the brain to learn and recall information. This book provides repeated practice with fun, motivating activities that will help your child develop the skills and confidence that lead to success!Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun. Each 56-page book features full-color activities, a list of the skills, and an explanation of why those skills are important for development. Also included are helpful tips, an answer key, a handy tracking sheet, stickers for acknowledging achievements, and appearances by the lovable Stick Kids!These right-sized (7 x 9) skill practice workbooks are perfect for use at school, or as entertaining activities on the go.

For example, look in a recipe book together and ask something like, If this cake recipe uses 3 eggs, how many eggs will I need for 4 cakes?Encourage your child to memorize four facts at a time. Have your child write the facts on index cards and keep the cards in a handy place. Then every so often, ask one of the facts (such as What is 4 × 5?). If your child can respond quickly and easily, you know that he or she has memorized the fact. Let your child put stickers on the facts that have been mastered, and keep the card in a special box or bag. "

Phonics is a method of teaching beginning readers to decode by learning the spoken sounds associated with written letters and letter pairs. To become skilled readers, children must internalize these associations in order to read words without having to sound them out letter by letter or part by part. In addition, phonics instruction gives new readers the tools necessary for making the important connection between sounds and their spellings. Becoming fluent or automatic with these skills helps develop reading fluency and builds a strong foundation in reading comprehension, an important skill for academic success.Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun. Each 56-page book features full-color activities, a list of the skills, and an explanation of why those skills are important for development.

At the end of each book, a number of different activities reinforce the key sounds from the book. Activities include rhyming words, key sound pages, the way letters work together, sight words, and a picture dictionary.To further aid phonic learning, the key sound of each book is highlighted throughout the story in red letters, helping children to focus on the different ways to spell each sound.Clare Fennell’s charming, whimsical illustrations bring these simple stories to life by delighting and engaging young minds.

Though that time may be a year or two away, it is not too early to begin preparing your child for a successful school experience. Research has shown that repetition is essential for the brain to learn and recall information. The quick and engaging activities in this book will provide your child with repeated practice of developmentally appropriate math skills and vocabulary. While these activities may seem simplistic, their mastery is essential. To make sense of numbers, children must learn not only the verbal counting sequence 1, 2, 3, but also the way to connect each count with an object known as one-to-one correspondence. In addition, children must understand the fact that the last spoken number corresponds to the number of items being counted. Becoming fluent, or automatic, with these skills helps develop fluency and build a strong foundation in mathematical thinking and reasoning, an important skill for academic success. Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun. Each 56-page book features full-color activities, a list of the skills, and an explanation of why those skills are important for development. Also included are helpful tips, an answer key, a handy tracking sheet, stickers for acknowledging achievements, and appearances by the lovable Stick Kids!These right-sized (7 x 9) skill practice workbooks are perfect for use at school, or as entertaining activities on the go.
