Gulliver awakens to find himself being held captive on an island called Lilliput by people who are only six inches tall! Although they don't trust him at first, soon enough the Lilliputians see how handy it can be to have Gulliver around—at least some of the time.

Children need many experiences grouping and separating objects to understand the meaning of these two operations. They also need to see and use number facts (such as 3 × 5 and 12 ÷ 4) in a variety of contexts, such as in describing sets of objects or pictures, or solving word problems, in order to achieve mastery. Research has shown that repetition is essential for the brain to learn and recall information. This book provides repeated practice with fun, motivating activities that will help your child develop the skills and confidence that lead to success!Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun. Each 56-page book features full-color activities, a list of the skills, and an explanation of why those skills are important for development. Also included are helpful tips, an answer key, a handy tracking sheet, stickers for acknowledging achievements, and appearances by the lovable Stick Kids!These right-sized (7 x 9) skill practice workbooks are perfect for use at school, or as entertaining activities on the go.

For example, look in a recipe book together and ask something like, If this cake recipe uses 3 eggs, how many eggs will I need for 4 cakes?Encourage your child to memorize four facts at a time. Have your child write the facts on index cards and keep the cards in a handy place. Then every so often, ask one of the facts (such as What is 4 × 5?). If your child can respond quickly and easily, you know that he or she has memorized the fact. Let your child put stickers on the facts that have been mastered, and keep the card in a special box or bag.

The activities in this book will help your child develop efficient comprehension strategies so he or she can become a better reader.Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun.

J. Palacio,,,360134,4.7,"A special movie tie-in edition of R.J. Palacio's #1 New York Times bestseller. Over 8 million people have fallen in love with Wonder and Auggie Pullman, the ordinary boy with the extraordinary face, who inspired a movement to Choose Kind and an upcoming graphic novel White Bird  - on sale 10/1/2019! This special movie tie-in edition features an eight-page full-color insert with photos from the film, a foreword by the director Stephen Chbosky, an afterword by R.J. Palacio, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie with anecdotes from the cast and crew, and a family discussion guide. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can’t get past Auggie’s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1 New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie’s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community’s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance.  ""Wonder is the best kids' book of the year,"" said Emily Bazelon, senior editor at Slate.com and author of Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel “a meditation on kindness” —indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.  Join the conversation: #thewonderofwonder, #choosekind  Read more",https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Movie-Tie-R-Palacio/dp/1524720194,Hardcover,success,

Phonics is a method of teaching beginning readers to decode by learning the spoken sounds associated with written letters and letter pairs. To become skilled readers, children must internalize these associations in order to read words without having to sound them out letter by letter or part by part. In addition, phonics instruction gives new readers the tools necessary for making the important connection between sounds and their spellings. Becoming fluent or automatic with these skills helps develop reading fluency and builds a strong foundation in reading comprehension, an important skill for academic success.Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun. Each 56-page book features full-color activities, a list of the skills, and an explanation of why those skills are important for development. Also included are helpful tips, an answer key, a handy tracking sheet, stickers for acknowledging achievements, and appearances by the lovable Stick Kids!These right-sized (7 x 9) skill practice workbooks are perfect for use at school, or as entertaining activities on the go. Tuck them into a backpack, purse, or travel bag. Great for school breaks, vacations, and year-long practice.SKILLSConsonant soundsLetter pair digraphs (ch, sh, th)Short vowel soundsVowel pair diphthongs (ou, ow, oi, oy)Long vowel soundsSounds of oo (as in moon and book)Y as a vowelR-controlled vowelsLetter pair blends with l, r, sHOW YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT LEARNINGWork with your child in a calm, quiet setting.Read with or to your child every day.Point to a word in your childs story book and ask him or her to tell you the sounds of the words letters.

For a century, America’s early childhood policy has been premised on a myth. This falsehood―which dictates that child care and education are somehow separate and distinct―not only suboptimizes the most important window into all human development, but costs American taxpayers an untold fortune. It’s time to think differently.Written in plain yet provocative language by one of the field’s most respected bipartisan policy experts, The Daycare Myth makes the case for why the early years matter; why America’s longstanding early childhood policy approach sacrifices the needs of young children in favor of promoting adult employment; and why fixing the problem makes good sense, regardless of your place on the political spectrum.With straightforward guidance for policymakers, practitioners, and parents, this incredibly timely book is a wake-up call for a nation that aspires to nothing less than the wholesale transformation of America’s early childhood landscape.Book Features:Invites readers to rethink their very understanding of the early years by outlining a bipartisan case for change.Addresses the needs of policymakers, practitioners, and parents individually with practical implications and action steps for each.Melds policy with what the current science of brain development tells us about the importance of children’s early years and the critical role they play in future success.Challenges longstanding assumptions, calls out ineffective approaches, and outlines a new path beneficial to children and families, employers, state and federal economies, and society as a whole.

Though that time may be a year or two away, it is not too early to begin preparing your child for a successful school experience. Research has shown that repetition is essential for the brain to learn and recall information. The quick and engaging activities in this book will provide your child with repeated practice of developmentally appropriate math skills and vocabulary. While these activities may seem simplistic, their mastery is essential. To make sense of numbers, children must learn not only the verbal counting sequence 1, 2, 3, but also the way to connect each count with an object known as one-to-one correspondence. In addition, children must understand the fact that the last spoken number corresponds to the number of items being counted. Becoming fluent, or automatic, with these skills helps develop fluency and build a strong foundation in mathematical thinking and reasoning, an important skill for academic success. Upon your childs completion of each activity, use the provided incentive chart and stickers to track progress and celebrate your childs success.Whether students need extra practice with grade-level skills or a head start on next year, Stick Kids® Workbooks offer engaging activities, games, and puzzles that help make learning lots of fun. Each 56-page book features full-color activities, a list of the skills, and an explanation of why those skills are important for development. Also included are helpful tips, an answer key, a handy tracking sheet, stickers for acknowledging achievements, and appearances by the lovable Stick Kids!These right-sized (7 x 9) skill practice workbooks are perfect for use at school, or as entertaining activities on the go.
