Phonics is a method of teaching beginning readers to decode by learning the spoken sounds associated with written letters and letter pairs. To become skilled readers, children must internalize these associations in order to read words without having to sound them out letter by letter or part by part. In addition, phonics instruction gives new readers the tools necessary for making the important connection between sounds and their spellings.

Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it's a melting pot where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when optimistic Officer Judy Hopps arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn't so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde, to solve the mystery. This Step 3 Step into Reading leveled reader based on Disney Zootopiafeatures a shiny cover and over 30 sparkly stickers!",Stk,,0736434569,9780736434560,,English,,Step into Reading,,,The Big Case (Disney Zootopia) (Step into Reading),https://www.amazon.com/Case-Disney-Zootopia-Step-Reading/dp/0736434569/ref=sr_1_1?currency=USD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BBMpt56zsk60juj-cRbftQ.uPi64_5aEOl08q-v2y_6reVyOugS5BWTwVZJQ0vUY7g&dib_tag=se&keywords=9780736434560&qid=1762879390&sr=8-1,,RH/Disney,,4 - 6,6.0,0.13,9.0

Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it's no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions – Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley’s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.

Though that time may be a year or two away, it is not too early to begin preparing your child for a successful school experience. Research has shown that repetition is essential for the brain to learn and recall information. The quick and engaging activities in this book will provide your child with repeated practice of developmentally appropriate math skills and vocabulary. While these activities may seem simplistic, their mastery is essential. To make sense of numbers, children must learn not only the verbal counting sequence 1, 2, 3, but also the way to connect each count with an object known as one-to-one correspondence. In addition, children must understand the fact that the last spoken number corresponds to the number of items being counted. Becoming fluent, or automatic, with these skills helps develop fluency and build a strong foundation in mathematical thinking and reasoning, an important skill for academic success.",,,1616017708,9781616017705,,English,,,,,"Number Fun Stick Kids Workbook, Grade PreK (Stick Kids Workbooks)",https://www.amazon.com/Number-Stick-Workbook-Grade-Workbooks/dp/1616017708/ref=sr_1_1?currency=USD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q7Oi9OcyIbbveGeqQ0tJrA.zi-KPIq6IH4vbzmuOBS_QwkGDoQWTq_LxW23P6iZ3E4&dib_tag=se&keywords=9781616017705&qid=1762890673&sr=8-1,,Creative Teaching Press,,,6.4,0.2,8.7

The activities in this book are designed to strengthen your childs phonemic awareness and phonics skills. Children need to have a strong understanding of spoken language before they can understand written language. Phonemic awareness focuses on the sounds used to form spoken words; phonics instruction associates sounds to written symbols (i.e., the alphabet). Together, they help children develop word-recognition skills, namely the ability to sound out unknown words. Mastering sound-symbol relationships gives beginning readers the confi dence and ability to decode new words. To become skilled readers, children must internalize these sound-symbol relationships in order to read words without having to sound them out letter by letter or part by part.",,,1616017821,9781616017828,,English,,,,,"Phonics Fun Stick Kids Workbook, Grade K",https://www.amazon.com/Phonics-Stick-Workbook-Grade-Workbooks/dp/1616017821/ref=sr_1_1?currency=USD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lC5twUQ5i7_Yp6Ky5Rr2Aw.cgopvw0AObrKbmPkrf9EO9hVLnVVKuMEJ0rqjj9dj7I&dib_tag=se&keywords=9781616017828&qid=1762890930&sr=8-1,,Creative Teaching Press,,,8.8,6.4,0.2

Using both visual and kinesthetic (or tactile) learning modalities helps strengthen retention of what is being learned. In addition, well-developed fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination can enhance abilities in other disciplines, such as the arts, sports, and music. Repetition is essential for the brain to learn and recall information. Also, assimilating similarities and differences helps the brain to organize and retain information. Letters are formed using a combination of curved and straight lines and strokes moving in different directions. In an effort to maximize learning, the letters in this book have been organized into three groups according to how they are formed rather than alphabetically.",,,1616017848,9781616017842,,English,,,,,"Printing Practice Stick Kids Workbook, Grade K",https://www.amazon.com/Printing-Practice-Stick-Workbook-Workbooks/dp/1616017848/ref=sr_1_1?currency=USD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p-Y2qPuDXnOQVwWi6_sJxQ.23WGpR1qbqXkycZnsjr5no5Ke7NwjpL5VnmE5-MeG_s&dib_tag=se&keywords=9781616017842&qid=1762890981&sr=8-1,,Creative Teaching Press,,,6.4,0.2,8.7
