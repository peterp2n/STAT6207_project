The books were an instant hit and Roger went on to create many more Mr Men and Little Miss characters.

Today, through his new book, he encourages anyone in the throes of contemporary life to make just one more day with dignity and purpose. Each morning, Andrews starts his day off with a simple written onepage statement of encouragement and insight into himself and others. Things I Say To Myself is a collection of some of those writings, and is written with respect to the many that serve in solo capacities in the fields of ministry, counseling, missions, social work, or just as a human being facing another day. Each page is a glimpse of the ongoing inner conversations that he uses to get through some of his most difficult and complex situations.  With articles written in no particular order, Things I Say To Myself reflects lifes randomness, and the humor is that of positive resolve. Join him as he reflects on own spiritual journey with insights into the complexities of simply being human in this book.","andrews, reflects, written, say, human, daily affirmations, self-help, spiritual growth, humor, personal resilience",610.0,,,,,2010-11-11,,Unknown,,https://www.amazon.com/Things-Say-Myself-Dale-Andrews-ebook/dp/B079JPD5PG/ref=sr_1_1?currency=USD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.rL-sr8cE80f10_gxthmzZQ.b6g33afDQCI-4P-IuI2hKVo5IJ4uBznjK6GJWfPPcRU&dib_tag=se&keywords=9781445442020&qid=1762882952&sr=8-1,,English,,9781445442020,Let's Play: Things I Say and Do Board Book Box,85.0,85.00,9781445442020,,77.922

They've added a chocolate waterfall you can swim in, a volcano for toasting marshmallows, a bulldozer-battling level, a baby-dinosaur-petting zoo, a not-very-merry merry-go-round, a boxing elephant called the Trunkinator, an X-ray room, a disco with light-up dance floor, the world's scariest roller coaster and a top-secret thirty-ninth level which hasn't even been finished yet! But what good is all this stuff when Andy and Terry are trying to write their fastest book ever? You'll have to read it to find out! The 52-Storey Treehouse Andy and Terry's incredible, ever-expanding treehouse has thirteen new storeys, including a watermelon-smashing level, a wave machine, a life-size snakes and ladders game (with real ladders and real snakes!), a rocket-powered carrot launcher, a Ninja Snail Training Academy and a high-tech detective agency with all the latest high-tech detective technology. Which is lucky, because they have a BIG mystery to solve - Where is Mr Big Nose??? The 65-Storey Treehouse Andy and Terry's amazing 65-Storey Treehouse now has a pet-grooming salon, a birthday room where it's always your birthday (even when it's not), a room full of exploding eyeballs, a lollipop shop, a quicksand pit, an ant farm, a time machine and Tree-NN: a 24-hour-a-day TV news centre keeping you up to date with all the latest treehouse news, current events and gossip. The 78-Storey Treehouse Join Andy and Terry in their 78-storey spectacular treehouse. They've added thirteen new levels including a drive-thru car wash, a combining machine, a scribbletorium, an ALL-BALL sports stadium, Andyland, Terrytown, a high-security potato chip storage facility and an open-air movie theatre. The 91-Storey Treehouse Join Andy and Terry in their 91-storey spectacular treehouse. They've added thirteen new levels, including the world's most powerful whirlpool, a mashed-potato-and-gravy train and a human pinball machine. Why not try your luck on the spin-and-win prize wheel or hang out in a giant spider web (with a giant spider), or you can always get your fortune told by Madam Know-it-all or eat a submarine sandwich the size of an actual submarine while deciding whether or not to push the big red button . . . The 104-Storey Treehouse Join Andy and Terry in their 104-storey spectacular treehouse. They've added thirteen new levels, including a never-ending staircase, a burp bank, and even a mighty fortress. But Andy and Terry are in a race against time to find a funny story for their next book – will the tooth fairy, the two-million-dollar shop or even the riddles of the deep-thoughts thinking room be able to help? The 117-Storey Treehouse Andy and Terry have added another thirteen levels of crazy fun to their every-growing treehouse. They've got a tiny-horse level, a pyjama-party room, an Underpants Museum and Treehouse Information Centre! But Andy and Terry have found themselves running from the Story Police and the only way to escape, is through the terrifying Door of Doom! The 130-Storey Treehouse We've added 13 new levels to our Treehouse including soap bubble blaster, a GRABINATOR (it can grab anything from anywhere at any time), a time-wasting level, a toilet paper factory (because you can never have too much toilet paper) and an extraterrestrial observation centre... Which will come in handy when giant flying eyeballs from outer space come to grabinate US!","treehouse, storey, terry, andy, thirteen, children's fiction, adventure, humor, imagination",3410.0,100.07,,,,2019-01-01,"8 - 10 years, from customers",Unknown,,https://www.amazon.com/Treehouse-Books-Collection-Griffiths-Storey-Treehouse-13/dp/9123881747/ref=sr_1_1?currency=USD&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NnOXI5_a21ke-rB7LhCpopvKaEs-7fBRb5w7VS5vWzc.WAuARoLG2eniO2UdhGpALJAHP_mRbLHH2jIXfRkmzNY&dib_tag=se&keywords=9781447287599&qid=1762883613&sr=8-1,,English,,9781447287599,Andy Griffiths: The 65-Storey Treehouse,89.0,95.00,9781447287599,SPECIAL PRICE,434.84999999999997
